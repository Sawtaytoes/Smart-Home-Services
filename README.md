# Smart Home Services
Flic, LIFX, and WeMo microservices for controlling smart home devices.

Using these packages, you can hook your Flic buttons up to a Raspberry Pi and control LIFX and WeMo devices. If you want to have other device support, that would need to be added separately.

There's plenty of example code available in this project.
