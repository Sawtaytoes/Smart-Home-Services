# HTTP LIFX LAN Controller

Allows toggling lights by scenes using the HTTP API. This allows Flic, Logitech POP, and similar buttons to act as 6-function, instead of 3-function, devices. A single button-press can now both turn on and turn off a scene or group depending on if lights are on or off in the scene.
